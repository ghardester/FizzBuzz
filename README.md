# FizzBuzz

This project is intended to show my thought process on how to solve FizzBuzz. 
I start off by listing all numbers 1-100. Then, I go and I look for multiples of 3 and 5 by using MOD.
I do this with the symbol %. So, where numbers are divisible by 3, I inserted Fizz, and for numbers 
divisible by 5, I put Buzz. The final part was to insert FizzBuzz where the number is both a multiple 
of 3 and 5. That is how I would go about solving a coding problem like this one.
